# Prompt the user for their monthly income and convert to a float
monthly_income = float(input("Enter your monthly income: "))

# Ask for their total monthly expenses and convert to a float
total_monthly_expenses = float(input("Enter your total monthly expenses: "))

# Calculate Monthly Savings
monthly_savings = monthly_income - total_monthly_expenses

# Assume a simple annual interest rate of 5% (0.05 as a decimal)
annual_interest_rate = 0.05

# Calculate the projected savings after one year, incorporating the interest.
# Formula: Projected Savings = Monthly Savings * 12 + (Monthly Savings * 12 * 0.05)
projected_annual_savings = (monthly_savings * 12) + (monthly_savings * 12 * annual_interest_rate)

# Display the userâ€™s monthly savings
print(f"Your monthly savings are ${monthly_savings:.2f}.") # .2f for two decimal places

# Display the projected annual savings after including interest
print(f"Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: ${projected_annual_savings:.2f}.")
